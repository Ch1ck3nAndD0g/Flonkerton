**A Video Game about PAPER 📑👩🏻‍💼**

_Built with Unity 5_

##### TODOs
* Small blue cars (starting on right) cut out of camera view
* Player gets stuck on 9th (or so) strip, need to click 3-4 times before player
  moves again
* Adding multiple cars to a road
* Randomizing game object generation
* Organize script methods
* Office-ify the game (various renaming needed - check TODOs in code)
**Ghost**
* ~Adjust ghost speed depending on how far it is from the player (slower when closer, faster when farther)~
* Increase ghost speed at higher player scores (increase difficulty)
* Ghost Hiding: Hide ghosts behind objects and have them jump on the main character
* Patrolling: Add waypoints (cubes) - add ghosts to grass strips and have them patrol from one waypoint to another
